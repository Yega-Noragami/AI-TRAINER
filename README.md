# AI-TRAINER

### ABOUT 
In this project we will be building an AI Trainer using OpenCV and Python. We will use the pose estimation running on the CPU to find the correct points and using these points we will get the desired angles. Then based on these angles we find many gestures including the number of Pushups 


## IDEA BEHIND

I decided to use Computer Vision to Track my joints. Using caclulations , i was able to find the number of repetitions for number of Push-up , Squat , etc. 

SQUAT                      |  PUSH-UP
